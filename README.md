# Jetpack Compose Sample Application

This is an Android app written in Kotlin, using the Jetpack Compose toolkit.

## Features
This project showcases:

- Material Design 3
- Making async requests that don't block the main thread.
- Separation of concerns between the UI design and state using ViewModels and StateFlow.
- Designing UI components that react to state changes in real time.
- Modular UI design, where each component is separate and only has access to data it needs.

A second card below the Stats card displays some text that you can scroll through while the request is running.
