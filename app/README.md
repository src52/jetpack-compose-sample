# Jetpack Compose Sample Application

## Features
This project showcases:

- Android app design using Kotlin and the Jetpack Compose toolkit.
- Making async requests that don't block the main thread.
- Properly managing app state with StateFlow
- Separation of concerns between the UI design and it's state using ViewModels.
- Designing UI components that react to state changes in real time.
- Modular UI design, where each component is separate and only has access to data it needs.

A second card below the Stats card displays some text that you can scroll through while the request is running.
